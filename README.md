🎓 Internship & Attachment Finder Platform
📌 Project Description

This project is a frontend web platform that helps university students in Rwanda find internship and attachment opportunities easily.

The system connects:

Students

Companies

Universities

It replaces informal methods such as WhatsApp messages, emails, and personal connections with a clear and organized website.

🎯 Problem

Many students from universities such as University of Rwanda, Adventist University of Central Africa, and INES-Ruhengeri face challenges like:

Not knowing where to find internships

Companies receiving many unqualified applications
